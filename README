-= CANiBUS Server =-

wiki: http://wiki.hive13.org/CANiBUS

-== Summary ==-
The CANiBUS Server connects one or more CAN devices to one or more researchers.
The CANiBUS Server has drivers for each CAN device that abstracts the
communication with the client.  It provides a method for multiple researchers
to connect to a Vehicle and work together to analyze the CANbus system.  This
allows for an unlimited number of research to work without additional strain
on the electrical system of the vehicle.  This works well for instructional
environment or remote research on a vehicle.

!!!NOTE!!! This is VERY ALPHA.  It may cause unexpected results to your
vehicle, which may include but are not limited to: stalling, bricking the
system, locking the brakes, or becoming a Decepticon.  We can not be held 
responsible for the use of this product.

-== Server Features ==-
Currently supported CAN Devices:
 * CANSIM - CAN bus simulator (built-in)
 * ELM32x - (Initial support added)
 ( more devices will be added as the server matures )

 * Lobby
 ** Lists available connected CAN devices
 ** Group chat for discussion prior to starting
 ** Ability to start a 'hack session' on a device

 * Hack Sessions
 ** Read-only mode (instructor mode)
 ** Chat private to that hack session

-== Client ==-
The protocol is documented on the wiki so any client can connect (or bot for
that matter).  The network protocol is XML an fairly self documenting but you
will want to refer to the server source or the wiki if you want to write your
own.  There is a built-in ncurses client in the client/ folder.  This code
can be used as an example on how to implement some of the APIs.  Ncurses
was chosen because:

* Simple interface
* Works via SSH
* Could be used as a server admin tool for CANiBUS server maintenance

-== Build Requirements ==-

* libcapsinetwork (server)
* libtinyxml (client)
* libncurses (client)

These should all be available via a debian based distro (get the -dev versions)

-== Credits ==-
This is for the Open Garages VRL project.  This has been used and tested
at the Hive13 VRL facility.
